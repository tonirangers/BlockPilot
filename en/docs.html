        <h1 id="chap1">CHAPTER 1: YOUR PRIVATE BANK 3.0</h1>
        
        <h2 id="1-1">1.1 The BlockPilot Philosophy</h2>
        <p>BlockPilot is the first private management solution that reconciles two worlds: the absolute security of a personal vault and the financial performance of DeFi (Decentralized Finance).</p>
        <p>Our mission is simple: transform your dormant crypto-assets into productive wealth. With us, Bitcoin or stablecoins are not objects of speculation; they are assets that must generate income.</p>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <strong>The 3 Pillars of our offer:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protection (Safe):</strong> You hold the funds legally and technically.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance (Yield):</strong> We put these funds to work to generate compound interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom (Zeal):</strong> You spend your earnings in real life with a card and an IBAN.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="1-2">1.2 Why Yield Changes Everything</h2>
        <p>Most crypto investors are content to buy and wait ("HODL"). It's like buying an apartment in Paris and leaving it empty for 10 years. It's a waste.</p>
        <p>BlockPilot activates the Yield.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Principle:</strong> We place your assets (Stablecoins, ETH, BTC, BNB) on liquidity markets so they earn interest, paid by the second.</li>
            <li><strong>The Difference:</strong> Unlike a bank that gives you 3% and keeps 4%, DeFi allows capturing value at the source.</li>
            <li><strong>Our Role:</strong> Yield is complex and technical. We select the best strategies, manage risk, and rebalance the portfolio for you. You collect, we work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="1-3">1.3 An "All-in-One" Experience (The Zeal App)</h2>
        <p>Security should not be a constraint. We have integrated your entire financial ecosystem into a single interface, the Zeal application, which acts as your central hub.</p>
        <p>No more complex transfers between 3 platforms. Everything is in one place:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Personal IBAN:</strong> To transfer Euros (in) or receive funds (out).</li>
            <li><strong>Your Crypto Wallet:</strong> To view your balance and sign operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Your VISA Card (Gnosis Pay):</strong> To spend your Yield directly at the bakery or book a flight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fluid On-Ramp / Off-Ramp:</strong> You move from your classic bank account to your BlockPilot Safe in an instant transfer. No friction.</p>

        <h2 id="1-4">1.4 Security Architecture (1 Client = 1 Vault)</h2>
        <p>To manage this wealth, we do not use a "common pot" (Pool) like platforms that have gone bankrupt in the past. We apply the rule of Total Segregation.</p>
        <p>We deploy a Safe (Smart Wallet) for you. It is a digital vault on the Blockchain, titled in your name.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You are the owner:</strong> The funds are with you, not with BlockPilot.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You can audit the existence of your funds 24/7 on the blockchain.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> We provide a clear quarterly report on performance and taxation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="1-5">1.5 Our Management Mandates (Your Profile)</h2>
        <p>Because every estate is unique, we adapt the governance of your vault to your risk profile and the amount invested.</p>
        
        <h3>A. The "Essential" Mandate (Safe 1/2 + Guard)</h3>
        <p>The standard for combining security and responsiveness.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operation:</strong> BlockPilot has an operator key to execute Yield strategies quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>The Guard (Safeguard):</strong> An on-chain security module technically blocks any transfer to an account that is not yours. We can generate yield, but we cannot leave with the cash.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. The "Heritage" Mandate (Safe 2/3 + Trusted Third Party)</h3>
        <p>The fortress for large capital.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operation:</strong> Every outgoing fund movement requires 2 out of 3 signatures (You + BlockPilot + Trusted Third Party like Notary/Lawyer).</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Security:</strong> This is the ultimate level of protection. Impossible to move funds without absolute consensus.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="1-6">1.6 Client Profile Management</h2>
        <p>Before deploying your Safe, we conduct a profile audit (Objectives).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are you looking for stable income (Cashflow)?</li>
            <li>Are you looking for aggressive growth (Accumulation)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We configure Yield strategies according to your time horizon and risk tolerance.</p>

        <h1 id="chap2">CHAPTER 2: YOUR ECOSYSTEM & FINANCIAL SERVICES</h1>
        <p>To operate your digital wealth, we use precise tools. This chapter translates technical jargon into concrete benefits and details the exclusive services you have access to.</p>

        <h2 id="2-1">2.1 Essential Vocabulary</h2>
        <p>You don't need to be an engineer to drive a Ferrari, but you need to know where the brake is.</p>
        
        <h3>A. The Safe (Your Vault)</h3>
        <p>This is your legal and technical entity on the Blockchain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A Safe multisignature Smart Contract.</li>
            <li><strong>What changes:</strong> Unlike a simple wallet (e.g., Ledger, Metamask) that depends on a single key, the Safe can require multiple validations and integrate complex security rules. It is the standard used by companies and institutional funds to secure billions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. The Guard (Your Bodyguard)</h3>
        <p>It is the invisible protection that allows us to work risk-free for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> It is a filter installed on the Safe. It checks every transaction before it leaves.</li>
            <li><strong>The Rule:</strong> It authorizes BlockPilot to interact with audited yield protocols (e.g., Aave, Curve), but it strictly forbids any sending of funds to an unknown wallet.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Even if BlockPilot were hacked, the hacker could not empty your vault, because the Guard would block the outgoing transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; color:#64748B;">Official Guard Addresses (Verifiable On-Chain):</p>
        <div class="code-block">

        </div>

        <h3>C. The Seed Phrase (Your Backup Key)</h3>
        <p>When creating your access (via the Zeal app), you receive a sequence of 12 or 24 words.</p>
        <div class="callout callout-important">
            <p><strong>Vital Importance:</strong> This is the only way to recover access to your funds if you lose your phone.</p>
            <p><strong>Segregation:</strong> BlockPilot does not know your Seed Phrase. You are its sole guardian. Store it offline (paper), never on a cloud.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="2-2">2.2 "Private Banking" Financial Services</h2>
        <p>Beyond yield, BlockPilot transforms your crypto-assets into powerful financial tools.</p>

        <h3>A. Reporting & Compliance (Tax Report)</h3>
        <p>Transparency is total.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real Time:</strong> You don't wait for the end of the month. You can verify the value of your assets (NAV) to the second via your Zeal application or public dashboards like DeBank.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Declaration:</strong> On demand, we generate a detailed report of transactions and capital gains, ready to be transmitted to your accountant. Thanks to the "1 Client = 1 Safe" architecture, your history is clean and isolated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Credit Line</h3>
        <p>Exclusive service to optimize your taxation and liquidity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Need:</strong> You need cash (real estate purchase, professional project) but you don't want to sell your cryptos (to avoid capital gains tax or because you believe in the rise).</li>
            <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> We use your assets secured in the Safe as collateral to obtain an immediate loan in Stablecoins or Euros.</li>
            <li><strong>The Advantage:</strong> It is a debt, therefore not taxable. You keep your crypto positions (and their upside potential) while unlocking liquid liquidity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="2-3">2.3 Pricing & Economic Model</h2>
        <p>Our remuneration is clear, contractual, and deducted directly by the Smart Contract. No invoice to pay manually.</p>
        
        <table class="doc-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Fee Type</th>
                <th>Amount</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Management Fee</strong></td>
                <td>0.50% / Quarter</td>
                <td>0.50% of the net asset value (NAV), charged at the end of each quarter. Covers 24/7 monitoring, Safe maintenance, gas fees for internal operations, and priority support.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Success Fee</strong></td>
                <td>4%</td>
                <td>4% of net profits generated. <em>"High Water Mark" Principle:</em> We only take this commission if we make money compared to the last reference value (BNAV).</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="2-4">2.4 Partner Program (Business Introduction)</h2>
        <p>Your network has value. If you recommend BlockPilot to your entourage (Investors, Business Leaders), we share the gains with you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Annuity:</strong> You receive 20% of all fees (Management + Performance) generated by your referrals.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurrence:</strong> It is a lifetime commission, as long as the client remains under management.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Automatic, paid to your Safe or your VISA card.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="chap3">CHAPTER 3: PREPARATION & ONBOARDING</h1>
        <p>To start management, you must have two things: a digital key (Wallet) and fuel (Crypto/Euros).</p>
        <p>BlockPilot does not ask for any identity documents (no KYC). The partner platforms (Zeal or MEXC) handle this to secure your bank transfers.</p>
        <p>Here is the exact procedure, in order.</p>

        <h2 id="3-1">Step 1: Create your "Key" (Zeal Wallet)</h2>
        <p>Everything starts here. This personal wallet will serve to sign contracts and, later, to recover your funds.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download Zeal:</strong> <a href="https://www.zeal.app/claim?r=yNI4%2Fwwr9cr4s%3Futm_channel%3Dsystem_share" target="_blank">Download Link</a></li>
            <li><strong>Create Wallet:</strong> Choose "Create new wallet" with the "Recovery Phrase" option.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure the Phrase (Vital):</strong> Write down the 12/24 words on paper. This is your only life insurance. Never give it to anyone.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="3-2">Step 2: Bring Liquidity (The Fuel)</h2>
        <p>For BlockPilot to work, you must have funds available on your wallet. Two methods depending on your preference:</p>
        
        <h3>Option A: The "All-in-One" Method (Recommended)</h3>
        <p>You activate the banking services integrated into Zeal.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In Zeal, request the activation of the Bank Account (IBAN) and/or Card.</li>
            <li>Zeal will ask for a quick identity verification (Partner KYC).</li>
            <li>Once validated, make a SEPA transfer from your bank to your new Zeal IBAN.</li>
            <li>You receive digital Euros directly in the app.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Option B: The "Exchange" Method (MEXC / Binance)</h3>
        <p>If you prefer to use an external platform or for large volumes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open an account on MEXC and validate their identity (KYC): <a href="https://promote.mexc.co/r/rO0gT3a8" target="_blank">Registration Link</a></li>
            <li>Deposit your Euros and convert them into Crypto (USDT/USDC/ETH).</li>
            <li>Perform a Withdrawal from MEXC to your Zeal wallet address (the one starting with 0x...).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> at the end of this step, you have your Zeal wallet open and funds (Crypto) on it. You are ready.</p>

        <h2 id="3-3">Step 3: Signature & Profile (Administrative)</h2>
        <p>Now that you are solvent, we formalize the mandate.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Contract Signature (On-Chain):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to the <a href="https://blockpilot.capital/fr/signature.html" target="_blank">Signature Page</a>.</li>
                    <li>Connect your Zeal and sign the transaction (it's free).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Investor Profile:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/QAmqwCXFMBHVJ7EHA" target="_blank">Profile Form</a>.</li>
                    <li>Here you paste your Zeal address (0x...) so I can identify you.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once done, send me a message (Telegram/Mail): "Toni, it's good, wallet ready and form filled."</p>

        <h1 id="chap4">CHAPTER 4: DEPLOYMENT & FOLLOW-UP (ACTIVATION)</h1>
        <p>This is the magic step. I take over to build your private banking infrastructure.</p>

        <h2 id="4-1">4.1 Building the Safe (My Role)</h2>
        <p>Upon receipt of your green light, I deploy your Safe on the Blockchain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I configure the 1/2 Signature (I can operate, you keep control).</li>
            <li>I install the Guard module (Anti-theft security).</li>
            <li>I verify that everything is operational.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="4-2">4.2 Transferring Funds (Funding)</h2>
        <p>I communicate the address of your new Safe to you.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From your Zeal wallet (or MEXC), you send your cryptos to the Safe address.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> We always do a small test (10€) before sending the rest. I accompany you live (Call/Chat) for this step if needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="4-3">4.3 Follow-up: "Watch Only" Mode (Pro Tip)</h2>
        <p>Once the funds are in the Safe, they are no longer "in" your main Zeal wallet (your key), but in the vault. To continue seeing your balance in the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In Zeal, click on your account logo.</li>
            <li>Choose "Add Account" > "Track any wallet" (or Watch Only).</li>
            <li>Paste your Safe address.</li>
            <li>Name it: "My BlockPilot Vault".</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Why is it great?</strong>
            <p>You have two views in the same app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Key (Personal Wallet):</strong> Empty (or with a little cash for daily use). This is your signing tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Vault (Safe):</strong> Full. You see the Yield coming in, performance evolving, but funds are protected by the Guard.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>For even finer analysis (curves, protocol details), you can also paste your Safe address on DeBank.com.</p>

        <h2 id="4-4">4.4 And to retrieve the money? (Off-Ramp)</h2>
        <p>The day you want to enjoy your earnings:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We trigger a transfer from the Safe to your personal Zeal Wallet (authorized by the Guard).</li>
            <li>From your personal Zeal, you use your VISA Card to spend or you make a transfer to your bank account via the IBAN.</li>
            <li>If you prefer, you send back to MEXC to retrieve Cash.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1 id="chap5">CHAPTER 5: YOUR DASHBOARD & DAILY MANAGEMENT</h1>
        <p>Your capital is now secured in your BlockPilot Safe.</p>
        <p>From this moment, a switch occurs: your personal Zeal Wallet becomes your "Signature Key" (it is empty or almost), and your Safe becomes your "Investment Account" (it is full).</p>

        <h2 id="5-1">5.1 Configuring the "Mirror" View (Watch Only)</h2>
        <p>This is the #1 question from new clients: "Toni, I sent the funds to the Safe, my Zeal wallet shows zero, is this normal?"</p>
        <p><strong>YES.</strong> It is normal because the funds have moved.</p>
        <p>To see the contents of your vault directly in your application, we use the "Watch Only" (Read Only) function.</p>
        <p><strong>The Manipulation (to be done once):</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In Zeal, click on your profile/account icon (top left).</li>
            <li>Select "Add Account".</li>
            <li>Choose "Track any wallet" (or "Watch address").</li>
            <li>Paste your Safe address (the one I gave you).</li>
            <li>Give it a name: "BlockPilot Vault".</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> You now have two views in the app.</p>

        <h2 id="5-2">5.2 Real-Time Audit (DeBank)</h2>
        <p>To go further than the simple balance and see the detail of strategies, we use DeBank. It is the industry standard for visualizing DeFi.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://debank.com" target="_blank">DeBank.com</a></li>
            <li>Paste your Safe address in the search bar.</li>
            <li><strong>What you see:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total Net Worth.</li>
                    <li>List of assets (USDC, ETH...).</li>
                    <li>Detail of Yield positions (e.g., "Aave Lending", "Uniswap V3 Liquidity").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Total Transparency:</strong> You see exactly what I see. Impossible to cheat on the numbers.</p>

        <h2 id="5-3">5.3 BlockPilot Management: Active Financial Engineering</h2>
        <p>Your money doesn't sleep. Once secured in the Safe, we deploy institutional yield strategies, usually inaccessible to individuals.</p>
        <p>It is not simply about "buy and wait", but capturing value where it is created, second after second.</p>
        
        <h3>What we do (The Expertise):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>1. Institutional Lending (Passive Income):</strong> We lend liquidity on over-collateralized decentralized money markets.
                <br><em>The principle:</em> Like a bank, we collect interest paid by borrowers.
                <br><em>Security:</em> Each loan is guaranteed by collateral greater than the amount lent. Default risk is managed algorithmically by the protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2. Market Making & Financial Mathematics:</strong> This is our core expertise. We act as Market Makers by providing liquidity to facilitate global exchanges.
                <br><em>The method:</em> We use mathematical models of "Ranges" (Concentrated Liquidity) to optimize the positioning of your capital.
                <br><em>The gain:</em> We capture a commission on transaction volumes. This is a complex strategy that requires constant algorithmic monitoring to remain profitable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>3. Arbitrage & Strategic Rotation:</strong> Yield rates in DeFi change every minute.
                <br><em>We monitor opportunities 24/7.</em>
                <br><em>If a market becomes less performing or riskier, we instantly move liquidity to a superior opportunity. It is this active management that makes the difference in performance over the year.</em>

            <strong>The Role of the Guard (Security):</strong> I have technical rights to execute these complex financial operations (Swaps, Deposits, Rebalancing) to generate performance.
            <br>However, the Guard watches closely: it technically forbids me to send funds to a destination other than validated protocols or your own wallet.

        <h2 id="5-4">5.4 Retrieving Your Gains (Off-Ramp)</h2>
        <p>The ultimate goal is to enjoy your money. The system is designed to be fluid.</p>
        <p><strong>The Exit Scenario:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Request:</strong> You send me a message: "Toni, I want to withdraw €5,000 for a vacation."</li>
            <li><strong>Execution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>I disengage capital from Yield strategies (Unstake/Withdraw).</li>
                    <li>I prepare the transfer transaction from the Safe to your personal Zeal Wallet.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Usage (The "Lifestyle"):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the funds are on your personal Zeal Wallet (your Key), they are available immediately.</li>
                    <li>You can spend them with your Zeal Card (Gnosis Pay).</li>
                    <li>Or you can transfer them to your classic bank account via your Zeal IBAN.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="5-5">5.5 What if...? (Risk Management)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"What if the market crashes?"</strong> Our strategies are mostly based on Stablecoins (which do not fluctuate) or major assets (ETH/BTC) depending on your profile. We do not play casino.</li>
            <li><strong>"What if I lose my phone?"</strong> Don't panic. Your funds are in the Safe on the Blockchain, not in the phone. Reinstall Zeal on another device, enter your Secret Phrase (Seed), and you regain access to your key and the view of your vault.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="chap6">CHAPTER 6: FAQ, SUPPORT & EMERGENCIES</h1>
        <p>Because trust relies on clarity, here are the answers to critical questions and procedures in case of a glitch.</p>

        <h2 id="6-1">6.1 Risk Management & Emergencies</h2>
        
        <h3>"I lost my phone / my Zeal access..."</h3>
        <p>Don't panic. Your money is not in your phone, it is on the Blockchain.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a new device (or reinstall Zeal).</li>
            <li>Select "I already have a wallet".</li>
            <li>Enter your Secret Phrase (the 12/24 words) that you wrote down on paper during registration.</li>
            <li>Access to your "Key" and your "Vault" is restored instantly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>"What happens if BlockPilot disappears?"</h3>
        <p>This is the strength of our Non-Custodial model.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legally:</strong> You are the sole owner of the funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Technically:</strong> You possess a key that allows you to force withdrawal or revoke our management rights at any time. If we disappear, your funds remain in your Safe, accessible by you alone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"What if the market collapses?"</h3>
        <p>We cannot control the market, but we manage exposure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our mandates are built with strict risk management.</li>
            <li>We often favor stable or major assets (Bitcoin/Ethereum) depending on your profile, avoiding speculative assets without liquidity.</li>
            <li><em>Transparency Note: All investment involves a risk of capital loss. Past performance does not prejudge future performance.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What if a protocol gets hacked?</h3>
        <p>This is the systemic risk of Decentralized Finance. Although we select only "Blue Chip" protocols (audited, proven, and securing billions like Aave or Uniswap), zero risk does not exist in computing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Distinction:</strong> Protocol Bankruptcy (Third Party Risk): If the code of Uniswap or Aave suffers a global attack or a critical bug (Smart Contract Exploit), BlockPilot cannot be held responsible for losses related to this external technological failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Our Management:</strong> We mitigate this risk through diversification (never putting all eggs in the same protocol) and active monitoring to withdraw funds at the first signs of anomaly.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety + Option:</strong> For large capital worried about this specific risk, we can study together the subscription of optional On-Chain Insurance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="6-2">6.2 Administration & Taxation</h2>
        
        <h3>"How to stop the mandate (Exit)?"</h3>
        <p>You are free. There is no blocking commitment period.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Send a withdrawal or termination request by email or Telegram.</li>
            <li>We disengage positions and funds are available on your Wallet to be spent or transferred to your bank.</li>
            <li>The mandate officially ends at the moment of your request (Effective Termination Date).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>"What are the exact fees?"</h3>
        <p>Everything is deducted automatically by the Smart Contract, you have nothing to pay manually.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> 0.50% per year (charged quarterly).</li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> 4% of net profits only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="6-3">6.3 VIP Support (Contact)</h2>
        <p>We are not a robot. BlockPilot is your private partner.</p>
        <p>For any question about a strategy, a deposit, or a withdrawal, contact your manager directly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Telegram (Quick Response):</strong> <a href="https://t.me/tonirangers" target="_blank">@tonirangers</a></li>
            <li><strong>Email (Administrative):</strong> <a href="mailto:support@blockpilot.capital">support@blockpilot.capital</a></li>
            <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Business Days, 09:00 – 18:00 CET (but we monitor positions 24/7)</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="chap7">CHAPTER 7: LEGAL FRAMEWORK & COMMITMENTS</h1>
        <p>Trust does not exclude control. BlockPilot operates under a strict contractual framework, governed by the laws of the Republic of Seychelles, designed to protect client property above all.</p>

        <h2 id="7-1">7.1 Entity & Jurisdiction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Company:</strong> The service is operated by Block Pilot Ltd, a company registered in Seychelles.</li>
            <li><strong>Applicable Law:</strong> This mandate is governed by the laws of the Republic of Seychelles (Seychelles Anti-Money-Laundering Act 2020).</li>
            <li><strong>Why this choice?</strong> This jurisdiction offers a clear framework for digital assets while respecting privacy, without the administrative heaviness unsuited to DeFi of traditional jurisdictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="7-2">7.2 Nature of the Mandate (Non-Custodial)</h2>
        <p>It is crucial to understand what you are signing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Bank Deposit:</strong> You do not deposit your money with BlockPilot.</li>
            <li><strong>Discretionary Management Mandate:</strong> You give us a technical authorization (signature) to manage assets in your own vault (Safe).</li>
            <li><strong>Inalienable Property:</strong> You remain the sole legal owner of assets at all times. BlockPilot is never a "custodian" of your funds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="7-3">7.3 Termination & Exit (Total Freedom)</h2>
        <p>You are not captive. You can terminate the contract at any time, without exit penalty (excluding performance fees due to date).</p>
        <p><strong>How to terminate?</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>By Notification:</strong> A simple email or written message is enough to act the end of the mandate.</li>
            <li><strong>By Technical Revocation:</strong> You have the sovereign power to revoke BlockPilot's signature key directly on the Blockchain. This instantly stops any possibility of management on our part.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Calculation:</strong> A "Termination Snapshot" (final photo) is taken on the end date to calculate the last pro-rata management fees and performance commission if positive.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="7-4">7.4 Data Protection (Privacy)</h2>
        <p>We apply a "Data Minimization" policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What we store:</strong> Only your email and the public address of your Safe.</li>
            <li><strong>What we DO NOT store:</strong> Your Seed Phrase, your personal banking data (managed by Zeal/Partners) or your full identity documents (except simplified verification).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="7-5">7.5 Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>In case of disagreement, we always favor amicable resolution (30 days). If the conflict persists, it will be settled by Arbitration in Victoria (Seychelles), guaranteeing a faster and confidential resolution than a classic public court.</p>
